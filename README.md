### About the I Ching
The [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching), or Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text. The person consulting the I Ching asks a question and yarrow sticks or coins are used to generate a response, which is a [hexagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_%28I_Ching%29), six lines of yin or yang. Each hexagram is given meaning through the arrangement of yin (broken) and yang (solid) lines and the [trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua) they form within the hexagram. Since each line has 2 possibilities there are 2<sup>6</sup> or 64 possible hexagrams. In addition, each line may be static or dynamic. A line may be yin, yang, old yin (becoming yang), or old yang (becoming yin). When there are dynamic lines, the reading will produce a Primary Hexagram and a Related Hexagram, produced by changes in the dynamic lines.

### About this repository
This project is a simple system for experimentation with programming languages and frameworks. The core logic, server-side behavior, and testing is implemented in Clojure for now, with other languages to come.
